<p>To cut your hair shorter at home first wet your hair so its a little damp and comb it to remove any knots and tangles. The fade is a short haircut to get on the sides and back giving guys a low-maintenance and modern cut that looks sleek. Stop about 1 inch 25 cm under where you cut with the longer blade. Turn the comb so that its teeth are pointed up and away from the scalp at a 30- to 45-degree angle.

<p>For the back of the head put a grade-two blade on your clippers for a standard cut or longer or shorter as desired. Hold your scissors straight up and down the length of your hair rather than across it and snip away just a little bit at a time. But now that the prospect of getting up close and personal with your neighborhood barber is a bit up in the air these days socialdistancing you might be thinking about taking matters into your own hands by cutting your own hair. For that many girls cut their hair short to save time. Pin On Art Material Haircut Men.</p>
