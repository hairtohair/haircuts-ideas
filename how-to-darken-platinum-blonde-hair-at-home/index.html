<p>Right so ive dyed my hair platinum blonde for the past two years and i really want to dye it back closer to my natural colour. By Staff Writer Last Updated April 13 2020 People with bleached blonde hair can darken their locks by gradually dying hair darker using a hair coloring product. Those who dont have the cash to shell out usually head to Sallys Beauty a common beauty store chain known for their vast lines of color and lightener. Some hairdressers will recommend using a good toning shampoo the violet toner helps remove the brassy yellow tones and leave you with a crisp white hue.

<p>You wanted a few sun-kissed pieces but walked out of the salon with full-on platinum strands. Then the brown shade is applied to the root and pulled through to the base of the hair. Ive had a high lift tint applied to my root regrowth and a semi applied to the lengths which have been bleached. Apply a hair mousse like LOréal Paris Advanced Hairstyle CURVE IT Elastic Curl Mousse to towel-dried hair scrunch your tresses then allow it to air dry for perfect curls.
