<p><strong>Should I Cut The Sides Of My Hair When Growing It Out</strong>, Adding in a few layers of extensions can help ease the transition not to mention help you to practice styling long hair which will happen sooner than you think.

Try parting your hair on the opposite side to hide the shaved side thats growing out. The cuts should be smooth and tapered.</p>

<p>You may grow out your hair and find out that you dont really like the way you look with long hair. What will happen is your hair will grow but wont get very much longer if at all since the ends will continually be breaking off. If a client does come to me with this request I usually advise them to go for a shorter haircut in order to catch up with the sides and start over with a more even base It might feel frustrating to want to grow out your hair and instead end up with shorter hair.
