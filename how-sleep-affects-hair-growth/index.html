<p>The negative impact of the lack of sleep on the body is very likely to impact the process of hair growth and may even be linked directly to hair loss and thinning hair. This hormone helps your body regulate your sleep cycle and it also has been shown to increase hair growth. Another one of the main benefits of sleep for natural hair growth is related to stress. If the bodys melatonin levels are down then there is a chance of extreme hair loss. Pin On Health Info.</p>
