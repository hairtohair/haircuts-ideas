<p>Try to visit your barber at least once every three to four months to get a mild trim make sure to let them know youre growing your hair out and to fix any areas that arent looking their best. When you go for your haircut in between growing it out you want to work with your barber on a plan to grow these areas of your hair out to the same length. I confess I did cut my hair off once. Trying to keep your stress levels down will lower Cortisol release in the body and help with mental health and hair growth.
