<p>As a mom of 4 she wears it short again. At age 11 she got her ponytail. Over the summer she tried to grow it out to a chin-length bob but once it began touching the back of her neck she demanded the adorable pixie cut shes sporting now. Since then it has varied in style but has stayed pretty short. Pin On Delightful Daughters.</p>
