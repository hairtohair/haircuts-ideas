<p>You want to come to the musical performances of your favourite kpop idol but just have a limited budget. In addition to performances and recording idols have to attend to other schedules including TV appearances and interviews. I have fell in love with kpop and my dream is to be a kpop idol i am currently 13 years old i love singing and dancing and have been taking dance classes for about 3 years now even before i was introduced to kpop i know it is hard but i wont give up i still need to work on a few things including my Korean which you definately will need. Training usually takes between 3 to 5 years so Id say people start pretty young. K Pop Bucket List Kpop Kdrama Funny Korean Celebrities.</p>
