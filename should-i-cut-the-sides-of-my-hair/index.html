My personal recommendation is to keep the hair on the slightly longer side of what you wantitll naturally spring up a few inches shorter when dry Keep your curls well moisturized to get the best out of them. Never shop for your haircut on price alone. Pin On My Style.</p>

<p>28 You must not make any cuts in your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. The side shave is left natural in this style but the rest of the hair is boldly colored giving the look a truly distinctive edge to it. If you fade the sides and keep the top long you wont achieve any of these looks because youll have a totally different hair style. We like Joico Curl Crème Wash Sulfate-Free CoWash.
