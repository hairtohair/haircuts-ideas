<p>Does layered hair look thicker or thinner. The easiest way to make your hair look thicker is to get a layered haircut that will frame your face and give your hair bounce. The perfect length of a haircut is up to your chest level and the layers should begin either above your chin or below it so that the layered strands could frame and soften the face lines. Strands of different lengths will make you look thinner by hiding the necessary areas. Pin On Hairstyles.</p>
