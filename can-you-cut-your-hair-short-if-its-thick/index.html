<p>My personal experience is quite different. So what it boils down to is that trimming your hair wont really make it grow back thicker. Yes it is thick and healthy than the damaged hair but it does not help to grow hair in the bald spots. It would help if I knew your age but Ill guess that youre fairly young.
