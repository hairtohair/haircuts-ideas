<p><strong>Which Shape Has 3 Faces</strong>, Which 3-D shape is regular. The correct answer is. A face is a 2D shape that makes up one surface of a 3D shape an edge is where two faces meet and a vertex is the point or corner of a geometric shape. A pyramid has a polygon as its base and the rest of its faces are triangles that meet at the same vertex.</p>
