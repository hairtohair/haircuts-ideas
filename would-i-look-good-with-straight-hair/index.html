I myself have super curly hair I have 3B hair if that tells you anything and its totally normal to feel weird if you wear them straight. Of course straight hair is not always fabulous. Straight hair is flat and lifeless. Pin By Balancinginheelz On Hollywood Glam Long Straight Hair Straight Hairstyles Celebrity Long Hair.</p>

<p>I never straightened my hair before but my friend says she can do it for today if i want. And of course lets not be naive to the fact that straight hair is the easiest to manage you cant have a bad hair day with straight hair. My hair is naturally curly and thats how i usually wear it. Not really straight hair doesnt suit my face. Pin On Long Bob.</p>
