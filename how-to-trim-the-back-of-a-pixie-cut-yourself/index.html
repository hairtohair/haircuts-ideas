CurlTalk member Mrl234 advised The best way to minimize the awkward growing out is keeping the bottom of the back trimmed while the rest of it catches up to avoid that ducktail mullet effect Whatsercurl agreed Mrl234 nailed it with the trims in the back. With a deep cut in the fabric ending halfway down your back or even all the way you might as well be walking on top of a red carpet. Pin On Kids.</p>

<p>It also helps me picture my goal hair style better. CurlTalk member Mrl234 advised The best way to minimize the awkward growing out is keeping the bottom of the back trimmed while the rest of it catches up to avoid that ducktail mullet effect Whatsercurl agreed Mrl234 nailed it with the trims in the back. Hair grows around 1 inch per month so calculate how long it will take to get to your ideal length so you can keep your expectations in check. Pixie cuts are ready to take on the world and dont need beauty essentials to get in the way. Pin On How To.</p>
