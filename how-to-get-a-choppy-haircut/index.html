The technique used depends on exactly how you want the finished cut to look but for the most choppy effect you want to perform what is known as point cutting where once the base haircut is completed you go back over the head and hold the hair in segments straight out from the scalp and cut inward from the ends of the hair at an angle to create notches in the hair. Use styling wax to accentuate individual strands. As you begin combing from the base of the section use your fingers to grasp the hair tightly.</p>
