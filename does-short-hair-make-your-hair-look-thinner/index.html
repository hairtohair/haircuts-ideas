<p>Make sure though that you dont let your hair poof out on the sides as that will add width to your visage. However it doesnt necessarily mean hair loss. When I got shorter layers cut into my hair it definitely made my hair look thinner at the bottom and I didnt like that on me. And that was true even at 14&ndash;decades before I had any hair loss.
