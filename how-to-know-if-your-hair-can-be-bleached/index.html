<p>If the hair is wet and stretches more than usual or the texture turns a bit gummy it is not safe to dye says senior colorist Meri Kate OConnor of. For bleaching you should check your strand test by rubbing off some of the bleach from the hair every 5-10 minutes to check how much the hair has lightened. Healthy undamaged hair will stretch to one-third of its original length. Try doing a small test strand in a foil somewhere toward the back of your head.

<p>Bleached Hair- Bleached hair is caused by the chemical process of dyeing your hair and the dye strips the color. To know the level of your natural hair pigmentation place a hair color depth chart close to your strands. Air dry hair as often as possible and explore heat-free hairstyles and no-blow-dry-required styling products which will give you the shape and hold you need without the need to use hot tools. Post bleaching the use of heat-styling products can contribute to more damage. Pin On Hair.</p>
