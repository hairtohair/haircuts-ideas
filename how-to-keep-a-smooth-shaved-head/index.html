<p>Look for one made from all-natural and organic oils and. We recommend using a quality pre-shave oil such as King of Shaves Alpha Oil to create a protective barrier between the blade and the skin. Before shaving rub a few pumps of good quality pre-shave oil onto your head lightly covering not saturating the scalp and remaining fuzz. Its really not that hard it has to do with the products you are using and how you go about shaving your head bald. So Beautifully Smooth Shaved Hair Women Bald Head Women Bald Heads.</p>
