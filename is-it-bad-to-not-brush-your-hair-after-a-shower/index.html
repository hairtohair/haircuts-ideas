<p><strong>Is It Bad To Not Brush Your Hair After A Shower</strong>, Instead brushing should always start mid-hair or a few inches from your ends.

Towel dried hair out of the shower is the easiest and most versatile state your hair can be in for a wide range of hair products to achieve a hairstyle you want.

<p>But the real hack Umma gave me was brushing your hair in the shower. When u brush the hair u are pulling the hair shaft and ripping it this will cause breakage and split ends. Instead try to dry them as much as possible after the bath and then brush their hair evenly and in the direction of the hairs growth. If you dont untangle it first your hair can become even more tangled by the washing process and when dry it can become a frizzy mess. Towel dried hair out of the shower is the easiest and most versatile state your hair can be in for a wide range of hair products to achieve a hairstyle you want.</p>
