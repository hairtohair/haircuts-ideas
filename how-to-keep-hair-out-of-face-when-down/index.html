<p>Does anybody have any techniques for clipping the front up. Try clipping back the sides try a small headbandits all trial and error and also TV stars with pretty hair to me have movement to their hair and yes hair does fall into their faces its common and I think it looks better than slicked hairsprayed hair. Redistributing your hair by using a centre or off-centre part helps avoid the heavy side falling in your face as well but a pin or tuck is still required to keep it off your face completely. It always falls in my face I cant stand it. Pinterest.</p>
