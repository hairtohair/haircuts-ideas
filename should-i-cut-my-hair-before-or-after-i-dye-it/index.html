<p>My hair is quite dry at the ends hence why i am getting it trimmed. I remember trying to put my hair in a ponytail about a week after I cut it but it was too short. But if theres not much hair being cut off then it should be done after a few days coloring because the ends of the hair become more split and dry hence the need for a fresh cut. So the question is to i dye the hair first and then get the hair cut or can i get the hair cut first and then dye. Pin On Highlights.</p>

<p>If a substantial amount of hair is to be cut off then it should be cut first otherwise the stylist is wasting product and time. If a substantial amount of hair is to be cut off then it should be cut first otherwise the stylist is wasting product and time. The only time I can see this making a difference is when the salon charges for color according to the length of the hair. It is very sobering reaching the age when you need to start using the just for men or going to a hair dresser every month to get your hair dyed. Pin On Good Hair.</p>
