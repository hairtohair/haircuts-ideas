<p>Im more concerned about skinny female idols because those girls can get really deathly skinny skinnier than BlackPink-skinny yet everyone still idolize their figures even though you can tell for sure that those girls have lost. I am indeed new to the K-Pop world and am loving everything I have learned. The thing is a lot of male Idols we adore are friends with people that have made sexist misogynistic and homophobic comments before maybe even themselves. But truth to be told I wont cancel someone for that you might as well cancel all male Idols then since I doubt theres a lot of exceptions of course theres some but theyre the exception not the rule.</p>
